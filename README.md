# NLP Keyword Extraction and Analysis - Forkaia Talent Showcase
My first attempt at keyword extraction and analysis using Spacy, pandas and numpy libraries and [Xu Liang's implementation of TextRank!](https://towardsdatascience.com/textrank-for-keyword-extraction-by-python-c0bae21bcec0) which was a great help.

I split the project into two parts - extraction and analysis. The extraction part code can be found in "keyword_extraction.py" and the results in "Keywords.xlsx." The analysis part code can be found in "keyword_analysis.py" and results in "Snapshot Figures and Analysis.xlsx"
